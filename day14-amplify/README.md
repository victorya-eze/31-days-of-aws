- React
- Angular
- Vue

 What This Code Does

This Terraform code:
- Creates an **Amplify app** connected to your GitHub repository
- Configures a **build spec** to build and deploy your app
- Creates an **IAM role** that Amplify uses to manage deployment
- Automatically triggers deployments when code is pushed to the main branch

Requirements

Before using this Terraform code, make sure you have the following:

 1. A GitHub Repository

Your GitHub repository should contain a supported web application project. Examples include:
- A React app created with `create-react-app`
- A Vue or Angular app scaffolded via CLI
- A static website with an `index.html` in the root folder or in a `build/` directory

A GitHub Personal Access Token

Your token must have the following scopes:
- `repo`
- `admin:repo_hook`

 **Do not hardcode your token!** Use `.tfvars` or environment variables for sensitive values.
