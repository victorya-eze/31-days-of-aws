What is AWS WAF?
AWS WAF is a web application firewall that lets you monitor and control incoming HTTP and HTTPS requests to your web applications. 

It helps mitigate threats such as:
SQL injection
Cross-site scripting (XSS)
IP reputation blocking
Rate-based attacks (e.g., DoS)

## Usage

```bash
terraform init
terraform apply

# Once finished, clean up
terraform destroy
```
